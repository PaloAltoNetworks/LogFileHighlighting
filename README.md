# Palo Alto Networks - Log file highlighting
Going through log files can be a pain.

The idea behind this repository is to highlight errors within the log files such that time spent troubleshooting can be kept to a minimum.

This is my first attempt at trying to use Sublime Text and it's syntax highlighting feature.

## Installing
### MacOS
1. Create a new directory in ```~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/```.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/Palo\ Alto\ Networks
```

2. Extract the `*.sublime-syntax` files into this new directory.

## Syntax Highlighting Capabilities
